#### getBorrowersForBook()

The `getBorrowersForBook()` function in `public/src/books.js` has two parameters, in the following order:

- A book object.
- An array of all account objects.

It should return an array of ten or fewer account objects that represents the accounts given by the IDs in the provided book's `borrows` array. However, each account object should include the `returned` entry from the corresponding transaction object in the `borrows` array.

**Example:**

```javascript
getBorrowersForBook(book, accounts);
/*
  [
    {
      id: "5f446f2e4eff1030e7316861",
      returned: true,
      picture: "https://api.adorable.io/avatars/75/barber.waters@kegular.biz",
      age: 37,
      name: {
        first: "Barber",
        last: "Waters",
      },
      company: "KEGULAR",
      email: "barber.waters@kegular.biz",
      registered: "Tuesday, April 14, 2020 9:15 PM",
    },
    {
      id: "5f446f2ecc5c4787c403f844",
      returned: true,
      picture: "https://api.adorable.io/avatars/75/dyer.trevino@slax.io",
      age: 34,
      name: {
        first: "Dyer",
        last: "Trevino",
      },
      company: "SLAX",

    },
  ]

### getMostPopularAuthors()

The `getMostPopularAuthors()` function in `public/src/home.js` has two parameters, in the following order:

- An array of book objects.
- An array of author objects.

It returns an array containing five objects or fewer that represents the most popular authors whose books have been checked out the most. Popularity is represented by finding all of the books written by the author and then adding up the number of times those books have been borrowed.

Each object in the returned array has two keys:

- The `name` key which represents the first and last name of the author.
- The `count` key which represents the number of times the author's books have been borrowed.

Even if there is a tie, the array should contain no more than five objects.

**Example:**

```javascript
getMostPopularAuthors(books, authors);
/*
  [
    { name: "Cristina Buchanan", count: 112 },
    { name: "Tami Hurst", count: 83 },
    { name: "Chrystal Lester", count: 80 },
    ...
  ]
*/
```
### Create a helper function

A helper function is a function that executes part of the logic of another function. Helper functions make your programs easier to understand by letting you give descriptive names to computations and reuse them. For this exercise, create at least one helper method for any of the functions that you implemented for this assignment.
